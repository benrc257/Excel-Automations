This is a set of programs I created for work to create and merge data reports from Handshake ".csv" files.
The merger also detects duplicates and lists the number of times a person appears in the reports.
Merged reports are also able to be re-merged while retaining the duplicate count.
The extractor pulls degrees from reports and organizes them by school, and attempts to fill in missing information.
